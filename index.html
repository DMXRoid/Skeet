<a name="1-overview" class="anchor" href="#1-overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1.) Overview</h1>

<p>Skeet is a fast, light weight, incredibly flexible PHP rapid development framework 
that utilizes features new in PHP 5.3 to allow for maximum usability with minimal
hassle.  Skeet provides an MVC, an ORM, a database abstraction layer, automatic
model/relationship code generation, a themed template engine.  Everything else 
about it is just a convenient way of arranging your code, whatever that code may
be.</p>

<p>In contrast to many other frameworks, like Zend, Symfony, Cake, or CodeIgniter, 
Skeet does not try to be all things to all people, nor does it force you into 
unneessarily restrictive code patterns that may not fit your needs.  Skeet will
never be a comprehensive set of libraries for PHP application development.  Instead,
after providing you with a foundation, Skeet lets you build your apps however 
you'd like, using whatever libraries you find useful.  If you like Form objects,
use one you like, or not.  Same with authetication, caching, AJAX calls, form
validation, and all the other mandatory libraries that clutter up and slow down other 
frameworks.</p>

<p>This philosophy is born out of experience.  Although full library frameworks like
the ones mentioned above do have their place, that place is not in the hands of 
big boy developers.  For complex, custom application development, those kinds of 
frameworks innevitably end up giving back their gains in time by drastically
increasing the cost of either going outside of the framework, or modifying the
core components.  The difference between those frameworks and Skeet is like 
the difference between osCommerce and a custom e-commerce application.  Sure,
you can probably eventually accomplish something like your goal with the former,
but it'll be painful.</p>

<p>Skeet objects are designed to be easily extendable, so you can make changes to 
core functionality without too much hassle.  A single Skeet instance can power 
multiple applications, and this design allows you to implement custom core 
functionality without having to impact other applications.  For organizations
that run multiple internal applications, this shared codebase can drastically
improve programmer productivity and application performance.  Additionally,
it's a piece of cake to share Skeet objects beteen applications with no additonal
overhead.  Referencing a model object in one application from another one is no more 
difficult than calling one native to your app.</p>

<p>Skeet is a programming framework for experienced developers creating complex 
business applications according to custom requirements.  It's not a catch-all,
and doesn't try to be.  Working within Skeet is made as easy as possible, so 
you can get down to the business of writing code.</p>
